Early Grade Prediction ðŸŽ“ðŸ“Š



Overview
This project focuses on predicting students' final grades early in the academic term using machine learning models. By leveraging continuous assessment data and other academic factors, the goal is to identify at-risk students early and provide timely interventions.

Key Features

Preprocessing of raw academic data for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand grade distribution and key predictors.

Implementation of multiple ML models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, etc.).

Performance evaluation with accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and reproducibility.

Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Use Cases

Early detection of students who may need academic support.

Data-driven decision-making for educators.

Academic performance monitoring tools.
